            I made this site to share some ideas and thoughts on different
            topics around the world of software development.
        </p>

            Here, you'll find info on random things I discovered, how I solved
            some problems, what I'm currently working on, and more.
        </p>

            I primarily work in the area of web development, but I take an
            active interest in all manners of programming. Check out my <a
